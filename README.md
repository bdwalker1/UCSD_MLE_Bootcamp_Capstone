Respository for files, data, etc. related to my capstone 
project for the UCSD MLE/AI Bootcamp(Mar 24 Cohort)

## 16.4.2 - Collect Your Data

### The Process

Searching for datasets I found many with computer network 
activity. However, many of the datasets consisted of 
activity as captured on a particular host/device. I was
looking for datasets that showed traffic accross a network
from multiple devices showing where they connected to,
what sort of network activity (port, protocol, etc.)
they engaged in, and some sort of metric(s) as to how
"big" the interaction was (connection duration, bytes
transferred, etc.)

### The Dataset

**Chosen dataset:**
Malware Detection in Network Traffic Data

**Dataset source:**
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/agungpambudi/network-malware-detection-connection-analysis/

**Dataset citation:**

Erquiaga. (2020). IoT-23: A labeled dataset with 
malicious and benign IoT network traffic (Version 1.0.0) 
[Data set]. Zenodo. http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4743746

**Dataset Overview**

This source provides datasets of network traffic logged 
from Internet of Things (IoT) devices.
The authors have provided this data for the express
intent of training machine learning models.
Within the dataset there is traffic from 23 separate devices.
20 of the devices were malware-infected and 3 devices
were not. 
The data from Kaggle is labeled with whether 
the traffic is benign or malicious to aid in
model evaluation.
